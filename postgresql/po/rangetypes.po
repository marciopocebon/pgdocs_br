For example, a range over the <type>numeric</type>type is continuous, as is a range over <type>timestamp</type>.

The canonical output for two ranges that represent the same set of values, for example the integer ranges <literal>[1, 7]</literal>and <literal>[1, 8)</literal>, must be identical. It doesn't matter which representation you choose to be the canonical one, so long as two equivalent values with different formattings are always mapped to the same value with the same formatting. In addition to adjusting the inclusive/exclusive bounds format, a canonicalization function might round off boundary values, in case the desired step size is larger than what the subtype is capable of storing.

In our example above, the function <function>float8mi</function>that underlies the regular <type>float8</type>minus operator can be used; but for any other subtype, some type conversion would be necessary.
