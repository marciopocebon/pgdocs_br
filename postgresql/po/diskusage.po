If the table has any columns with potentially-wide values, there also might be a <acronym>TOAST</acronym>file associated with the table, which is used to store values too wide to fit comfortably in the main table (see <xref linkend=\"storage-toast\">). There will be one valid index on the <acronym>TOAST</acronym>table, if present. There also might be indexes associated with the base table. Each table and index is stored in a separate disk file possibly more than one file, if the file would exceed one gigabyte.
