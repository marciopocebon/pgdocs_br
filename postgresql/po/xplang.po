msgid "<productname>PostgreSQL</productname>allows user-defined functions to be written in other languages besides SQL and C. These other languages are generically called <firstterm>procedural languages</firstterm>( <acronym>PL</acronym>s). For a function written in a procedural language, the database server has no built-in knowledge about how to interpret the function's source text. Instead, the task is passed to a special handler that knows the details of the language. The handler could either do all the work of parsing, syntax analysis, execution, etc. itself, or it could serve as <quote>glue</quote>between <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>and an existing implementation of a programming language. The handler itself is a C language function compiled into a shared object and loaded on demand, just like any other C function."
