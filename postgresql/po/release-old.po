#: xml/release-old.xml:29(para)
msgid "Functions used in index expressions and partial-index predicates are evaluated whenever a new table entry is made. It has long been understood that this poses a risk of trojan-horse code execution if one modifies a table owned by an untrustworthy user. (Note that triggers, defaults, check constraints, etc. pose the same type of risk.) But functions in indexes pose extra danger because they will be executed by routine maintenance operations such as <command>VACUUM FULL</command>, which are commonly performed automatically under a superuser account. For example, a nefarious user can execute code with superuser privileges by setting up a trojan-horse index definition and waiting for the next routine vacuum. The fix arranges for standard maintenance operations (including <command>VACUUM</command>, <command>ANALYZE</command>, <command>REINDEX</command>, and <command>CLUSTER</command>) to execute as the table owner rather than the calling user, using the same privilege-switching mechanism already used for <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</literal>functions. To prevent bypassing this security measure, execution of <command>SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION</command>and <command>SET ROLE</command>is now forbidden within a <literal>SECURITY DEFINER</literal>context.
