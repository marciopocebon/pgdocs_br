msgstr ""

#: xml/release-8.2.xml:38(para)
msgid "This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key constraint. That could result in failure to show a foreign key constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that it depends on a different constraint than the one it really does."

(Run <literal>pg_config --sharedir</literal>if you're uncertain where <replaceable>SHAREDIR</replaceable>is.) This must be repeated in each database to be fixed."

msgstr ""

#: xml/release-8.2.xml:110(para)
msgid "For a cascading foreign key that references its own table, a row update will fire both the <literal>ON UPDATE</literal>trigger and the <literal>CHECK</literal>trigger as one event. The <literal>ON UPDATE</literal>trigger must execute first, else the <literal>CHECK</literal>will check a non-final state of the row and possibly throw an inappropriate error. However, the firing order of these triggers is determined by their names, which generally sort in creation order since the triggers have auto-generated names following the convention <quote>RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN</quote>. A proper fix would require modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky to change it in existing releases. So this patch just changes the creation order of the triggers. Users encountering this type of error should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its triggers into the right order."
