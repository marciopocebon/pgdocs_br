We can filter these grouped rows using <literal>HAVING</literal>: <placeholder-2/><screen>city | max ---------+----- Hayward | 37 (1\n    row)</screen>which gives us the same results for only the cities that have all <structfield>temp_lo</structfield>values below 40. Finally, if we only care about cities whose names begin with <quote><literal>S</literal></quote>, we might do: <placeholder-3/><placeholder-4/>"

The fundamental difference between <literal>WHERE</literal>and <literal>HAVING</literal>is this: <literal>WHERE</literal>selects input rows before groups and aggregates are computed (thus, it controls which rows go into the aggregate computation), whereas <literal>HAVING</literal>selects group rows after groups and aggregates are computed. Thus, the <literal>WHERE</literal>clause must not contain aggregate functions; it makes no sense to try to use an aggregate to determine which rows will be inputs to the aggregates. On the other hand, the <literal>HAVING</literal>clause always contains aggregate functions. (Strictly speaking, you are allowed to write a <literal>HAVING</literal>clause that doesn't use aggregates, but it's seldom useful. The same condition could be used more efficiently at the <literal>WHERE</literal>stage.)"
