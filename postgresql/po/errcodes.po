msgid "All messages emitted by the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>server are assigned five-character error codes that follow the SQL standard's conventions for <quote>SQLSTATE</quote>codes. Applications that need to know which error condition has occurred should usually test the error code, rather than looking at the textual error message. The error codes are less likely to change across <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>releases, and also are not subject to change due to localization of error messages. Note that some, but not all, of the error codes produced by <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>are defined by the SQL standard; some additional error codes for conditions not defined by the standard have been invented or borrowed from other databases."

msgid "According to the standard, the first two characters of an error code denote a class of errors, while the last three characters indicate a specific condition within that class. Thus, an application that does not recognize the specific error code might still be able to infer what to do from the error class."

Such names are supplied in separate fields of the error report message so that applications need not try to extract them from the possibly-localized human-readable text of the message. As of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>9.3, complete coverage for this feature exists only for errors in SQLSTATE class 23 (integrity constraint violation), but this is likely to be expanded in future."
