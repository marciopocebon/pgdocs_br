msgid "The following conventions are used in the synopsis of a command: brackets ( <literal>[</literal>and <literal>]</literal>) indicate optional parts. (In the synopsis of a Tcl command, question marks ( <literal>?</literal>) are used instead, as is usual in Tcl.) Braces ( <literal>{</literal>and <literal>}</literal>) and vertical lines ( <literal>|</literal>) indicate that you must choose one alternative. Dots ( <literal>...</literal>) mean that the preceding element can be repeated."

A <firstterm>user</firstterm>could be anyone who is using, or wants to use, any part of the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>system. These terms should not be interpreted too narrowly; this book does not have fixed presumptions about system administration procedures."
