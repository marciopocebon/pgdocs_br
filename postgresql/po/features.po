msgid "The formal name of the SQL standard is ISO/IEC 9075 <quote>Database Language SQL</quote>. A revised version of the standard is released from time to time; the most recent update appearing in 2011. The 2011 version is referred to as ISO/IEC 9075:2011, or simply as SQL:2011. The versions prior to that were SQL:2008, SQL:2003, SQL:1999, and SQL-92. Each version replaces the previous one, so claims of conformance to earlier versions have no official merit. <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>development aims for conformance with the latest official version of the standard where such conformance does not contradict traditional features or common sense. Many of the features required by the SQL standard are supported, though sometimes with slightly differing syntax or function. Further moves towards conformance can be expected over time."

A large subset of these features represents the <quote>Core</quote>features, which every conforming SQL implementation must supply. The rest of the features are purely optional. Some optional features are grouped together to form <quote>packages</quote>, which SQL implementations can claim conformance to, thus claiming conformance to particular groups of features."
