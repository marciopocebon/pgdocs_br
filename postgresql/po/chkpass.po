msgid "This module implements a data type <type>chkpass</type>that is designed for storing encrypted passwords. Each password is automatically converted to encrypted form upon entry, and is always stored encrypted. To compare, simply compare against a clear text password and the comparison function will encrypt it before comparing."
msgstr ""

#: xml/chkpass.xml:13(para)
msgid "There are provisions in the code to report an error if the password is determined to be easily crackable. However, this is currently just a stub that does nothing."
msgstr ""

#: xml/chkpass.xml:16(para)
msgid "If you precede an input string with a colon, it is assumed to be an already-encrypted password, and is stored without further encryption. This allows entry of previously-encrypted passwords."
msgstr ""

#: xml/chkpass.xml:20(para)
msgid "On output, a colon is prepended. This makes it possible to dump and reload passwords without re-encrypting them. If you want the encrypted password without the colon then use the <function>raw()</function>function. This allows you to use the type with things like Apache's <literal>Auth_PostgreSQL</literal>module."

#: xml/chkpass.xml:26(para)
msgid "The encryption uses the standard Unix function <function>crypt()</function>, and so it suffers from all the usual limitations of that function; notably that only the first eight characters of a password are considered."
