msgid "PostgreSQL can be extended to run user-supplied code in separate processes. Such processes are started, stopped and monitored by <command>postgres</command>, which permits them to have a lifetime closely linked to the server's status. These processes have the option to attach to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s shared memory area and to connect to databases internally; they can also run multiple transactions serially, just like a regular client-connected server process. Also, by linking to <application>libpq</application>they can connect to the server and behave like a regular client application."
