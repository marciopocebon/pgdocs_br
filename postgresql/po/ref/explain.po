msgid "This command displays the execution plan that the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>planner generates for the supplied statement.

msgid "The most critical part of the display is the estimated statement execution cost, which is the planner's guess at how long it will take to run the statement (measured in cost units that are arbitrary, but conventionally mean disk page fetches). Actually two numbers are shown: the start-up cost before the first row can be returned, and the total cost to return all the rows. For most queries the total cost is what matters, but in contexts such as a subquery in <literal>EXISTS</literal>, the planner will choose the smallest start-up cost instead of the smallest total cost (since the executor will stop after getting one row, anyway). Also, if you limit the number of rows to return with a <literal>LIMIT</literal>clause, the planner makes an appropriate interpolation between the endpoint costs to estimate which plan is really the cheapest."

msgid "In order to measure the run-time cost of each node in the execution plan, the current implementation of <command>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</command>adds profiling overhead to query execution. As a result, running <command>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</command>on a query can sometimes take significantly longer than executing the query normally. The amount of overhead depends on the nature of the query, as well as the platform being used. The worst case occurs for plan nodes that in themselves require very little time per execution, and on machines that have relatively slow operating system calls for obtaining the time of day."
