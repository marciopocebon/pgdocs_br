msgid "The <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>rule system allows one to define an alternative action to be performed on insertions, updates, or deletions in database tables. Roughly speaking, a rule causes additional commands to be executed when a given command on a given table is executed. Alternatively, an <literal>INSTEAD</literal>rule can replace a given command by another, or cause a command not to be executed at all. Rules are used to implement SQL views as well. It is important to realize that a rule is really a command transformation mechanism, or command macro. The transformation happens before the execution of the command starts. If you actually want an operation that fires independently for each physical row, you probably want to use a trigger, not a rule. More information about the rules system is in <xref linkend=\"rules\">.</xref>"

Thus, an <literal>ON SELECT</literal>rule effectively turns the table into a view, whose visible contents are the rows returned by the rule's <command>SELECT</command>command rather than whatever had been stored in the table (if anything). It is considered better style to write a <command>CREATE VIEW</command>command than to create a real table and define an <literal>ON SELECT</literal>rule for it."

If the rule is conditional, or is not <literal>INSTEAD</literal>, then the system will still reject attempts to perform the update action, because it thinks it might end up trying to perform the action on the dummy table of the view in some cases. If you want to handle all the useful cases in conditional rules, add an unconditional <literal>DO INSTEAD NOTHING</literal>rule to ensure that the system understands it will never be called on to update the dummy table. Then make the conditional rules non- <literal>INSTEAD</literal>; in the cases where they are applied, they add to the default <literal>INSTEAD NOTHING</literal>action.
