msgid "<command>REINDEX</command>is similar to a drop and recreate of the index in that the index contents are rebuilt from scratch. However, the locking considerations are rather different. <command>REINDEX</command>locks out writes but not reads of the index's parent table. It also takes an exclusive lock on the specific index being processed, which will block reads that attempt to use that index. In contrast, <command>DROP INDEX</command>momentarily takes an exclusive lock on the parent table, blocking both writes and reads. The subsequent <command>CREATE INDEX</command>locks out writes but not reads; since the index is not there, no read will attempt to use it, meaning that there will be no blocking but reads might be forced into expensive sequential scans."
