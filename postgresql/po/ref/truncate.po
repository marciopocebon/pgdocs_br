msgid "<command>TRUNCATE</command>quickly removes all rows from a set of tables. It has the same effect as an unqualified <command>DELETE</command>on each table, but since it does not actually scan the tables it is faster. Furthermore, it reclaims disk space immediately, rather than requiring a subsequent <command>VACUUM</command>operation. This is most useful on large tables."
