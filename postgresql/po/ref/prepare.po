msgid "<command>PREPARE</command>creates a prepared statement. A prepared statement is a server-side object that can be used to optimize performance. When the <command>PREPARE</command>statement is executed, the specified statement is parsed, analyzed, and rewritten. When an <command>EXECUTE</command>command is subsequently issued, the prepared statement is planned and executed. This division of labor avoids repetitive parse analysis work, while allowing the execution plan to depend on the specific parameter values supplied."

msgid "Prepared statements have the largest performance advantage when a single session is being used to execute a large number of similar statements. The performance difference will be particularly significant if the statements are complex to plan or rewrite, for example, if the query involves a join of many tables or requires the application of several rules. If the statement is relatively simple to plan and rewrite but relatively expensive to execute, the performance advantage of prepared statements will be less noticeable."

msgid "If a prepared statement is executed enough times, the server may eventually decide to save and re-use a generic plan rather than re-planning each time. This will occur immediately if the prepared statement has no parameters; otherwise it occurs only if the generic plan appears to be not much more expensive than a plan that depends on specific parameter values. Typically, a generic plan will be selected only if the query's performance is estimated to be fairly insensitive to the specific parameter values supplied."

#: xml/ref/prepare.xml:141(para)
msgid "Although the main point of a prepared statement is to avoid repeated parse analysis and planning of the statement, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>will force re-analysis and re-planning of the statement before using it whenever database objects used in the statement have undergone definitional (DDL) changes since the previous use of the prepared statement. Also, if the value of <xref linkend=\"guc-search-path\">changes from one use to the next, the statement will be re-parsed using the new <varname>search_path</varname>. (This latter behavior is new as of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>9.3.) These rules make use of a prepared statement semantically almost equivalent to re-submitting the same query text over and over, but with a performance benefit if no object definitions are changed, especially if the best plan remains the same across uses. An example of a case where the semantic equivalence is not perfect is that if the statement refers to a table by an unqualified name, and then a new table of the same name is created in a schema appearing earlier in the <varname>search_path</varname>, no automatic re-parse will occur since no object used in the statement changed. However, if some other change forces a re-parse, the new table will be referenced in subsequent uses.</xref>"
