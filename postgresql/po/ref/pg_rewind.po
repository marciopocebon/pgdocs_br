#: xml/ref/pg_rewind.xml:51(para)
msgid "<application>pg_rewind</application>is a tool for synchronizing a PostgreSQL cluster with another copy of the same cluster, after the clusters' timelines have diverged. A typical scenario is to bring an old master server back online after failover, as a standby that follows the new master."
msgstr ""

#: xml/ref/pg_rewind.xml:57(para)
msgid "The result is equivalent to replacing the target data directory with the source one. All files are copied, including configuration files. The advantage of <application>pg_rewind</application>over taking a new base backup, or tools like <application>rsync</application>, is that <application>pg_rewind</application>does not require reading through all unchanged files in the cluster. That makes it a lot faster when the database is large and only a small portion of it differs between the clusters."
msgstr ""

#: xml/ref/pg_rewind.xml:67(para)
msgid "<application>pg_rewind</application>examines the timeline histories of the source and target clusters to determine the point where they diverged, and expects to find WAL in the target cluster's <filename>pg_xlog</filename>directory reaching all the way back to the point of divergence. In the typical failover scenario where the target cluster was shut down soon after the divergence, that is not a problem, but if the target cluster had run for a long time after the divergence, the old WAL files might not be present anymore. In that case, they can be manually copied from the WAL archive to the <filename>pg_xlog</filename>directory. Fetching missing files from a WAL archive automatically is currently not supported."
msgstr ""

#: xml/ref/pg_rewind.xml:82(para)
msgid "When the target server is started up for the first time after running <application>pg_rewind</application>, it will go into recovery mode and replay all WAL generated in the source server after the point of divergence. If some of the WAL was no longer available in the source server when <application>pg_rewind</application>was run, and therefore could not be copied by <application>pg_rewind</application>session, it needs to be made available when the target server is started up. That can be done by creating a <filename>recovery.conf</filename>file in the target data directory with a suitable <varname>restore_command</varname>."
