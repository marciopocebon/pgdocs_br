msgid "In the default <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>configuration, the autovacuum daemon (see <xref linkend=\"autovacuum\">) takes care of automatic analyzing of tables when they are first loaded with data, and as they change throughout regular operation. When autovacuum is disabled, it is a good idea to run <command>ANALYZE</command>periodically, or just after making major changes in the contents of a table. Accurate statistics will help the planner to choose the most appropriate query plan, and thereby improve the speed of query processing. A common strategy for read-mostly databases is to run <xref linkend=\"sql-vacuum\">and <command>ANALYZE</command>once a day during a low-usage time of day. (This will not be sufficient if there is heavy update activity.)</xref></xref>"

One or both of these can be omitted if <command>ANALYZE</command>deems them uninteresting (for example, in a unique-key column, there are no common values) or if the column data type does not support the appropriate operators.

msgid "For large tables, <command>ANALYZE</command>takes a random sample of the table contents, rather than examining every row. This allows even very large tables to be analyzed in a small amount of time. Note, however, that the statistics are only approximate, and will change slightly each time <command>ANALYZE</command>is run, even if the actual table contents did not change. This might result in small changes in the planner's estimated costs shown by <xref linkend=\"sql-explain\">. In rare situations, this non-determinism will cause the planner's choices of query plans to change after <command>ANALYZE</command>is run. To avoid this, raise the amount of statistics collected by <command>ANALYZE</command>, as described below.</xref>"

msgid "The extent of analysis can be controlled by adjusting the <xref linkend=\"guc-default-statistics-target\">configuration variable, or on a column-by-column basis by setting the per-column statistics target with <command>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS</command>(see <xref linkend=\"sql-altertable\">). The target value sets the maximum number of entries in the most-common-value list and the maximum number of bins in the histogram. The default target value is 100, but this can be adjusted up or down to trade off accuracy of planner estimates against the time taken for <command>ANALYZE</command>and the amount of space occupied in <literal>pg_statistic</literal>. In particular, setting the statistics target to zero disables collection of statistics for that column. It might be useful to do that for columns that are never used as part of the <literal>WHERE</literal>, <literal>GROUP BY</literal>, or <literal>ORDER BY</literal>clauses of queries, since the planner will have no use for statistics on such columns.</xref></xref>"

This second set of statistics is needed when planning queries that traverse the entire inheritance tree. The autovacuum daemon, however, will only consider inserts or updates on the parent table itself when deciding whether to trigger an automatic analyze for that table.
